Genesis seeks to address this challenge by incorporating AI-driven summarization features that encourage users to engage with their notes on a deeper level, fostering reflection and critical analysis.

## 2.3 Cognitive Considerations in Note-Taking: Handwritten vs. Digital

Research on note-taking practices has explored the cognitive implications of different methods, particularly comparing the effectiveness of handwritten notes versus digitally typed notes. "Note-taking and Handouts in The Digital Age" delves into this debate, highlighting studies that suggest a potential advantage for handwritten notes in promoting conceptual understanding and retention. A notable study by Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014), as cited in the review, found that students who took handwritten notes demonstrated better comprehension of conceptual material compared to those who used laptops for note-taking, even though both groups performed similarly on factual recall questions. This finding aligns with the encoding hypothesis, which posits that the act of physically writing notes aids in deeper cognitive processing and encoding of information.

However, the review also acknowledges the benefits of digital note-taking, particularly in terms of speed, legibility, and searchability. These practical advantages cannot be overlooked, especially in fast-paced learning environments. The challenge lies in finding a balance between leveraging the efficiency of digital tools while mitigating potential negative impacts on cognitive processing. Genesis aims to strike this balance by offering a platform that supports diverse note-taking preferences, allowing users to choose between typing or handwriting entries while providing AI-powered features to enhance comprehension and retention regardless of the input method.

## 2.4 Expressive Writing and Its Impact on Physical and Mental Well-Being

Beyond the practical aspects of journaling and note-taking, research has explored the potential therapeutic benefits of expressive writing. "Expressive Writing: Connections to Physical and Mental Health" provides a comprehensive overview of this field, highlighting the positive effects of writing about emotional experiences on both subjective and objective markers of health and well-being. Numerous studies have demonstrated that individuals who engage in expressive writing exhibit:

a. Reduced physician visits: Writing about emotional upheavals has been associated with a decrease in healthcare utilization, suggesting potential benefits for physical health.  
b. Improved immune function: Studies have shown positive effects on immune markers, including T-helper cell growth and antibody responses to vaccinations.  
c. Enhanced mood and well-being: Expressive writing can lead to long-term improvements in mood, reduced distress, and increased life satisfaction.  
d. Improved academic and professional outcomes: Students who engage in expressive writing have demonstrated improvements in grades, while professionals have shown increased success in job searching.  

These findings underscore the potential of expressive writing as a valuable tool for promoting both physical and mental well-being. While Genesis is not intended as a replacement for professional therapy, it aims to provide a platform that facilitates self-reflection and emotional processing, potentially contributing to the positive outcomes associated with expressive writing.
