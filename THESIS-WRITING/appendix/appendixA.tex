The Gantt chart illustrates the overlapping nature of software development phases, showing how research activities began before the official Week 1 start date and continued throughout the project. The timeline demonstrates realistic development patterns including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Extended Research Phase}: Literature review and requirements analysis extended beyond initial estimates to ensure comprehensive understanding
    \item \textbf{Iterative Design Process}: UI/UX design overlapped with development phases, reflecting agile methodology principles
    \item \textbf{Parallel Development}: Core features and AI integration developed concurrently to optimize timeline
    \item \textbf{Continuous Documentation}: Technical documentation and thesis writing maintained throughout the project lifecycle
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Testing}: Multiple testing phases ensuring quality deliverables
\end{itemize}

The critical path activities (marked in red) include documentation tasks that span the entire project duration, emphasizing the importance of continuous documentation in academic projects.
