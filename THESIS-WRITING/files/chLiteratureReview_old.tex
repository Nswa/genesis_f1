However, the transition to digital journaling is not without its challenges. Potential drawbacks include distractions arising from multitasking on digital devices, the possible impact on learning and retention, dependency on technology, and privacy concerns. Addressing these concerns is crucial for ensuring the effectiveness and ethical implementation of digital journaling solutions. Notably, research suggests that while digital tools can aid in capturing more extensive entries, they might not necessarily translate to improved self-reflection outcomes. This finding underscores the importance of promoting active engagement and deep processing of information during journaling, rather than simply relying on verbatim transcription. Collective seeks to address this challenge by incorporating AI-driven analysis features that encourage users to engage with their entries on a deeper level, fostering reflection and critical analysis \cite{baikadi2016exploring}.

\section{Cognitive Considerations in Journaling: Handwritten vs. Digital}\label{sec:cognitive}

Research on journaling practices has explored the cognitive implications of different methods, particularly comparing the effectiveness of handwritten entries versus digitally typed content. Studies suggest a potential advantage for handwritten notes in promoting conceptual understanding and retention. A notable study by Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) found that students who took handwritten notes demonstrated better comprehension of conceptual material compared to those who used laptops for note-taking, even though both groups performed similarly on factual recall questions \cite{mueller2014pen}. This finding aligns with the encoding hypothesis, which posits that the act of physically writing aids in deeper cognitive processing and encoding of information.

However, digital journaling also offers benefits, particularly in terms of speed, legibility, and searchability. These practical advantages cannot be overlooked, especially in fast-paced environments. The challenge lies in finding a balance between leveraging the efficiency of digital tools while mitigating potential negative impacts on cognitive processing. Collective aims to strike this balance by offering a platform that supports diverse journaling preferences, allowing users to choose their preferred input method while providing AI-powered features to enhance comprehension and retention regardless of the input method \cite{moore2015notetaking}.
