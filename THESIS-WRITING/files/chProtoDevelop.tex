\chapter{Prototype/ Product Development}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter discusses the details of the prototype and product development concerning the Collective journaling application. It clarifies each interface of the mobile journaling system and provides additional information on front-end development using Flutter, back-end integration with Firebase, and AI-powered features through DeepSeek API. The chapter demonstrates how the prototype addresses the identified problems of digital journaling complexity while maintaining the intimate experience of traditional journaling.

\section{System Prototype}

The Collective journaling application is developed using Flutter framework with Dart programming language, providing cross-platform compatibility for both Android and iOS devices. Firebase serves as the backend-as-a-service platform, offering authentication, cloud storage, and real-time database capabilities. The system integrates with DeepSeek AI API for intelligent journal analysis and insight generation. Local storage is managed through Sembast database, ensuring offline functionality with automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored.

The application follows an offline-first architecture where users can write entries without internet connectivity, and the system automatically syncs data to the cloud when available. This approach addresses the core requirement of maintaining uninterrupted journaling experience regardless of connectivity status. The integration of Flutter, Firebase, and AI services ensures the system is both efficient and user-friendly while providing intelligent features that enhance the traditional journaling experience.

\section{Development Environment Setup}

The development environment utilizes Flutter SDK with the following key dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flutter framework for cross-platform mobile development
    \item Firebase suite for authentication and cloud services
    \item Sembast for local database management
    \item HTTP client for DeepSeek API integration
    \item Material Design 3 for consistent UI components
    \item Camera and image processing capabilities for multimedia entries
\end{itemize}

The project structure follows Flutter best practices with organized directories for screens, services, models, widgets, and utilities. Custom plugins are maintained in the local\_plugins directory to address specific compatibility requirements, particularly for social authentication features.
