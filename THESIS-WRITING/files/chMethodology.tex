\end{figure}

Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes quick development and iteration of prototypes over rigorous planning and testing. It is particularly useful for projects where requirements are expected to evolve or are not fully understood at the outset. The RAD methodology consists of four main phases: requirement planning, user design, construction, and cutover. This model was chosen for the development of the \textbf{Collective} mobile journaling application due to its flexibility and focus on user feedback, which is crucial for creating a user-friendly and effective application. The detais of the project is discussed below:

\section{Requirement planning}\label{sec:requirementPlanning}   

The requirement planning phase is the first step in the RAD methodology, where the project team identifies and defines the requirements of the application. This phase involves gathering information from stakeholders, including potential users, to understand their needs and expectations. The goal is to create a clear and concise set of requirements that will guide the development process.

\section{User design}\label{sec:userDesign}

The user design phase is the second phase of the RAD methodology where users interact and participate in the non-technical design aspects of the project. User feedback is collected to determine the system architecture. During this phase, designs such as user interface, database structure, and workflow processes are designated based on user requirements. User design is a continuous interactive process that allows users to approve the design model that meets their needs. The activity diagrams below illustrate the detailed flow for each use case identified in the system.
