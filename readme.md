# ABSTRACT

**Collective** is a mobile journaling application designed to bridge the gap between traditional and digital journaling methods. While traditional pen-and-paper journaling offers a personal, distraction-free experience, it lacks modern capabilities like searchability and organization. Conversely, digital journaling platforms provide these technical advantages but often sacrifice the intimate, focused experience through feature overload and complex interfaces. 

Collective addresses this dichotomy by maintaining the simplicity of traditional journaling while intelligently implementing digital capabilities. The app features a minimalist interface where users focus solely on writing one entry at a time with a simple swipe-to-save gesture. Behind this streamlined experience, artificial intelligence processes entries to automatically generate summaries, identify emotional patterns, and organize content without user intervention. This approach eliminates the friction that typically causes users to abandon journaling practices.

By combining the emotional connection of traditional journaling with the practical benefits of digital tools, Collective creates a sustainable journaling experience that adapts to users' needs without demanding their attention for maintenance tasks.

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Background and Motivation

Journaling has long been recognized as a powerful tool for mental wellness, self-reflection, and personal growth. The practice dates back centuries, with historical figures from Marcus Aurelius to Leonardo da Vinci documenting their thoughts and experiences through handwritten journals. In contemporary society, journaling continues to be recommended by mental health professionals as an effective method for processing emotions, clarifying thoughts, and tracking personal development.

Despite these benefits, many individuals struggle to maintain a consistent journaling practice. The traditional method—writing with pen and paper—offers an intimate, distraction-free experience that many find conducive to authentic self-expression. However, physical journals present limitations in searchability, organization, and accessibility. Finding specific entries, identifying patterns over time, or having access to past reflections when needed can be cumbersome or impossible with traditional methods.

The digital revolution introduced numerous journaling applications intended to address these limitations. These platforms typically offer robust search functionality, cloud synchronization, multimedia integration, and organizational features. Yet, these technical advantages often come at the cost of simplicity and focus. Many digital journaling applications present users with complex interfaces filled with features that, while potentially useful, create cognitive load and distraction during what should be a mindful activity.

This paradox leads to a significant problem: users either choose the intimate but limited experience of traditional journaling or opt for feature-rich digital platforms that often feel impersonal and overwhelming. The result is that many people abandon journaling altogether, unable to find a solution that balances emotional connection with practical utility.

Collective was developed to resolve this tension. By rethinking the fundamental design approach to digital journaling, Collective aims to preserve the essence of traditional journaling—simplicity, focus, and emotional connection—while leveraging modern technology to overcome its limitations. Rather than exposing complexity to users, Collective employs artificial intelligence to handle organizational tasks behind the scenes, allowing users to focus solely on the act of writing.
