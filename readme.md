# ABSTRACT

**Collective** is a mobile journaling application designed to bridge the gap between traditional and digital journaling methods. While traditional pen-and-paper journaling offers a personal, distraction-free experience, it lacks modern capabilities like searchability and organization. Conversely, digital journaling platforms provide these technical advantages but often sacrifice the intimate, focused experience through feature overload and complex interfaces. 

Collective addresses this dichotomy by maintaining the simplicity of traditional journaling while intelligently implementing digital capabilities. The app features a minimalist interface where users focus solely on writing one entry at a time with a simple swipe-to-save gesture. Behind this streamlined experience, artificial intelligence processes entries to automatically generate summaries, identify emotional patterns, and organize content without user intervention. This approach eliminates the friction that typically causes users to abandon journaling practices.

By combining the emotional connection of traditional journaling with the practical benefits of digital tools, Collective creates a sustainable journaling experience that adapts to users' needs without demanding their attention for maintenance tasks.
